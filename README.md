# **Minecraft-like OpenGL Game Engine**  
---

## **Overview**  
This is a C++ game engine using OpenGL to render a block-based world. It features dynamic mesh generation, real-time rendering with shaders, player movement with collision detection, and efficient chunk-based world management.  

## **Features**  
- **OpenGL Rendering**: Uses shaders, VAO/VBO, and textures for efficient 3D graphics.  
- **Dynamic Mesh Generation**: Only visible faces of blocks are rendered to optimize performance.  
- **Chunk-based World System**: The world is divided into chunks that load and unload dynamically.  
- **Player Movement & Collision Detection**: Supports movement with gravity, jumping, and collision checks against blocks.  
- **Custom Shader Management**: Handles vertex and fragment shaders for lighting and texturing.  


### **Dependencies**  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- C++17 or later  
- OpenGL  
- GLFW (for window and input handling)  
- GLAD (for OpenGL function loading)  
- GLM (for matrix and vector math)  
- stb_image (for texture loading)  


## **Code Structure**  
### **Core Components**  
- `game.cpp`: Main game loop, handling updates and rendering.  
- `window.cpp`: Initializes GLFW, processes input, and manages OpenGL context.  
- `renderer.cpp`: Handles rendering, shader usage, and texture binding.  
- `shader.h`: Loads and compiles shaders.  
- `player.cpp`: Implements movement, camera controls, and collision detection.  
- `world.cpp`: Manages the worldâ€™s chunks and block storage.  
- `chunk.cpp`: Generates and stores block data, optimizes mesh creation.  

## **Key Concepts**  
### **OpenGL Rendering**  
- Uses shaders (`blockVertexShader.glsl`, `blockFragShader.glsl`) to handle lighting and textures.  
- Uses VAOs and VBOs for efficient rendering of block meshes.  
- Applies transformation matrices (`model`, `view`, `projection`) for 3D rendering.  

### **Block & World System**  
- The world consists of **chunks**, each storing blocks in a 3D array.  
- Only **visible** block faces are rendered to improve performance.  
- Uses **simplex noise** (if implemented) for terrain generation.  

### **Player Movement & Collisions**  
- Movement controlled via keyboard (`WASD` for movement, `SPACE` for jumping).  
- Uses **AABB collision detection** to prevent the player from passing through blocks.  
- Implements **gravity** and jumping mechanics.  

## **Controls**  
- `WASD` - Move forward, backward, left, right  
- `SPACE` - Jump  
- `ESC` - Quit the game  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Add lighting and shadows.  
- Implement a procedural world generator.  
- Optimize rendering using instancing or greedy meshing.  
- Improve physics with smoother movement and collision handling.
