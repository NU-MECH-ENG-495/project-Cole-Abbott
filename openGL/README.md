# ME495 - Project Proposal - Cole Abbott

For my project, I want to make some sort of game. While I am interested in robotics, I don't have any big project I am working on right now. A lot of my programming experience came from making  simple games so I thought it would be fun to make a game for this project. I would be interested in doing something that involoves 3D graphics, but don't have any experience with that. I have a few ideas in mind but would want to brainstorm more ideas before starting.

 I think the first step is to learn about graphics and how to render to a window in c++. Then I would try to render some shapes on the screen, and then have a player that can move around. Then I would focus on the actual emements of the game. 


# ME495 - Revised Project Proposal - Cole Abbott

For my project, I will make a game engine renderer using openGL. The final goal will be to render a scene that the player can move around in. I will start by following an openGL tutorial to learn how it works, and then I will make it able to render 3D objects on the screen.
